# Handling KeyError and TypeError in Python
This repository contains a Python code example demonstrating an uncommon error scenario. A list comprehension is used to extract values from a list of dictionaries.  The code showcases robust error handling to gracefully manage potential `KeyError` exceptions (when a key is missing) and `TypeError` exceptions (when the input data is not in the expected format). The solution improves the code to handle these uncommon errors more effectively. 

## Bug
The original code lacks comprehensive error handling.  If the input `data` is not a list of dictionaries, or if dictionaries lack the expected 'value' key, it crashes. 

## Solution
The solution includes a `try-except` block to catch both `KeyError` and `TypeError` exceptions. If an error occurs, an informative message is printed, and an empty list is returned to prevent program termination.
